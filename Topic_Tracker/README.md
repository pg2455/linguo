<b><Note:</b> The links here will not work.

**What is it?**

Topic Tracker is aimed at keeping track of what is being read or talked about most in the lab.
It accepts url links in the form of JSON with "Content-Type: application/json".
Typical JSON file will look like this:

{"url":"http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2014/07/09/alice-goffman-on-the-run.html"}

*NOTE : quotes here should be double quotes or url will not be processed*

**How does it work?**

It uses [LDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) implemented in [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/).
